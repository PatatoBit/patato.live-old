					  Hi there, I&apos;m Pat. A student from Thailand that is interested in coding, especially in Web Development, Apps, and Bots.    
					  I am currently studying secondary school at Intertots Trillingual School and code for fun.
					  I want to hopefully code for a living and move abroad as soon as possible for better life quality and opportunities.
